2
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:22,195
Crixus honors the memory
of your husband.

3
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:23,530
As do we all.

4
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:27,868
We should put these
dark times behind us...

5
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:32,406
And with Solonius' blood...

6
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,308
Amend our grief.

7
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:39,479
<i>Crixus! Crixus!</i>

8
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:42,249
<i>Crixus! Crixus! Crixus!</i>

9
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:56,163
I request words with Batiatus,

10
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,664
yet you return absent the man.

11
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:01,401
Other matters occupy
his attention.

12
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:03,336
I've pressed for
audience all week.

13
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:06,873
Dominus forgets who
his champion is.

14
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:09,209
It is you who forgets title,

15
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:11,578
master and slave.

16
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:19,586
Apologies.

17
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:21,955
I have made many mistakes
since becoming champion.

18
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:25,358
Know that I intend
to rectify them shortly.

19
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:36,336
Good citizens of Capua!

20
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,243
I stand before you,

21
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:46,213
the sting of tears
yet hot upon my cheek,

22
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,216
to redress a most vile crime

23
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:51,284
against our city
and our hearts.

24
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:56,823
The murder of Magistrate
Titus Calavius!

25
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:03,663
His life stolen

26
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:06,733
for lust of profit
and advancement.

27
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:11,104
His warmth and guidance

28
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:12,839
torn from our hands...

29
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:19,112
And those of loving wife
and Noble son!

30
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:23,950
Yet today we shall
witness justice!

31
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,155
The base criminal
that has so wounded us

32
00:05:29,223 --> 00:05:33,326
shall be executed ad gladium!

33
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:39,566
Enter Solonius!

34
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:42,435
Enemy of the people!

35
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,410
<i>Fucking pig!</i>

36
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:52,812
<i>Traitor!</i>

37
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:59,920
<i>Slice his
traitor tongue off!</i>

38
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:01,087
<i>You fucking pig!</i>

39
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:24,844
And who shall
balance the scales?

40
00:06:24,912 --> 00:06:28,481
Who shall restore
honor to our city?

41
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:31,818
<i>Spartacus!
Spartacus! Spartacus!</i>

42
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:36,222
There is but one man!

43
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,258
The slayer of Theokoles!

44
00:06:38,326 --> 00:06:39,593
The bringer of rain!

45
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:43,396
Spartacus...

46
00:06:43,464 --> 00:06:45,865
<i>Champion of Capua!</i>

47
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:10,056
You survived your
execution, Thracian.

48
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:11,691
Upon these very sands.

49
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:15,462
Perhaps good Solonius
will fare as well.

50
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:18,632
I would not expect it.

51
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,610
Begin!

52
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,848
Fight me, damn it!

53
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:43,056
Why does Spartacus
not strike in return?

54
00:07:43,124 --> 00:07:46,459
He but extends the moment,
to the favor of the crowd.

55
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:48,561
<i>The villain's blood
will flow soon enough.</i>

56
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:51,498
Your husband has been
a gift from the gods.

57
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:54,334
Numerius would be lost
without his support.

58
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:57,170
He gains great comfort
in the act.

59
00:07:57,238 --> 00:07:58,705
The comfort is ours.

60
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:02,308
He will make a fine father,
when the day comes.

61
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:05,311
Look, Spartacus draws blood.

62
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:26,566
You are not absent skill.

63
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:27,701
Nor desire to live.

64
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,246
You see?

65
00:08:40,314 --> 00:08:42,348
Solonius comes to his end.

66
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,583
And who would not wish it?

67
00:08:45,186 --> 00:08:48,188
The streets of Rome are wet
with tears of your loss.

68
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,727
<i>We have not received word
from you, Ilithyia.</i>

69
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:57,931
Did you speak to your husband?

70
00:08:57,998 --> 00:09:00,233
About patronage
for the House of Batiatus?

71
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:02,001
At length.

72
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:04,137
He comes to Capua a day hence,

73
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:05,705
to discuss the matter
personally.

74
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:30,964
The roar of the crowd.

75
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:32,632
There is no sound
more glorious.

76
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:36,236
The last you shall hear.

77
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:39,873
You take the wrong life.

78
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,909
Your master Batiatus,
is the villain.

79
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:48,848
And shall join you presently.

80
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:56,956
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

81
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:46,573
<i>Spartacus!
Spartacus! Spartacus!</i>

82
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:00,420
<i>I would not have
agron risk himself</i>

83
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,055
<i>on behalf of
brotherly bond.</i>

84
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:04,257
See him separated from
duro in future games.

85
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:05,558
And, what of Spartacus?

86
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,594
He grows restless at
not receiving audience.

87
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:10,463
The proceedings with Solonius
have filled my attentions.

88
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:12,565
Send mira to occupy
his thoughts.

89
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:14,267
I will summon him
in the morning.

90
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:15,435
Dominus.

91
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:24,777
Robes, fit for a man of
breeding and intelligence!

92
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:26,112
You wear them well.

93
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:29,215
Today day beheld
the end of Solonius.

94
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:31,651
A welcomed spectacle,
given purchase

95
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,519
by your loyalty and cunning.

96
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:36,189
You shall be removed from
the Ludus immediately.

97
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,025
Removed?

98
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:40,960
You'll reside in the villa.

99
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:43,263
Elevated far above
the common men,

100
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,165
your devious fucking mind
close to elbow.

101
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:54,440
Gratitude seizes the tongue.

102
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:58,044
Well perhaps a woman will aid
in the untangling of it.

103
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:00,880
Name any slave,
and the wet joys

104
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:02,548
<i>of her body are yours.</i>

105
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,155
I confess to certain longings.

106
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:14,794
For one not yet soiled
by the other men.

107
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:18,398
Give name to your desire,
and see it fulfilled.

108
00:12:31,412 --> 00:12:32,512
Apologies.

109
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:35,048
My presence was commanded.

110
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:39,953
By Batiatus?

111
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,622
His words set me to purpose.

112
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,290
But they were
gladly received...

113
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,334
I tend your wound.

114
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:56,970
<i>Stand guard at your
request while you</i>

115
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:58,304
<i>stain hands with blood.</i>

116
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:02,208
<i>And you discard
a simple touch?</i>

117
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:11,250
My mind is taken
with other thoughts.

118
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,098
Then break open head
and share them.

119
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:31,971
I fear Batiatus suspects
my hand in aulus' death.

120
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,973
He appears absent the weight
of pressing concern.

121
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,608
Then why does he not
grant me audience?

122
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:42,782
What secrets did aulus
reveal in dying breath,

123
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,950
that so inflamed?

124
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:51,924
That his hand
robbed Sura of life.

125
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:57,263
By command of Batiatus.

126
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,337
You plan vengeance!

127
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:12,412
You cannot do this!

128
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:16,783
Spartacus...
That is not what she called me!

129
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:20,920
Never again will I hear her
whisper my true name.

130
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:22,755
Or taste the joy
of it on her lips.

131
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,460
I will see the light
fade from his eyes,

132
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:30,596
or join her in the attempt.

133
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,432
At expense of my life?

134
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:37,837
The Thracian does not
know Roman law!

135
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:44,343
If one slave spills
the blood of his master...

136
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:47,113
All are put to death.

137
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:53,853
Each to his own fate.

138
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:57,156
And I to mine.

139
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:28,354
You move with strong purpose...

140
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:31,757
Spurred, by your victory.

141
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,532
When I defeated pericles,

142
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,200
and you were not
in the pulvinus...

143
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,741
There is no meaning to glory,

144
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,343
without your eyes to witness.

145
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:58,050
They will never
again be absent.

146
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:06,526
<i>Naevia?</i>

147
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:09,795
Hurry!

148
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:10,963
Quickly!

149
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:18,671
<i>Naevia!</i>

150
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,175
Domina.

151
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,377
What business do you attend,
that you do not answer?

152
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:26,379
Fetching wine, Domina.

153
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:27,513
Apologies, I did not hear..

154
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:29,448
Leave it.

155
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:31,617
There is a service required
of you by Dominus.

156
00:16:55,342 --> 00:16:57,610
<i>My heart quickens
at such a vision.</i>

157
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:00,112
<i>Please...</i>

158
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,849
Set mind to ease.

159
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:07,153
I cling to no grudge
for past transgressions.

160
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:10,489
I do not understand.

161
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:12,592
You spoke with Doctore,

162
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:16,295
after it was said Barca
secured his freedom.

163
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:18,264
I told him nothing.

164
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:19,932
A thing of no consequence.

165
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:22,568
Turn it from your thoughts.

166
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:24,904
As I have
turned it from mine...

167
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:29,575
In favor of more...

168
00:17:29,643 --> 00:17:31,344
Intimate concerns...

169
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:36,649
I have admired your
beauty for many years.

170
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:40,620
Were you aware
of my affections?

171
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:45,324
I have felt your gaze
linger of late.

172
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:50,429
A gaze is all I could dare....

173
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:55,635
Your position placing you
forever beyond my grasp.

174
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:03,509
Delicate, ripe naevia.

175
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:07,580
Always the forbidden fruit.

176
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:10,216
Until now...

177
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:16,689
You tremble.

178
00:18:19,326 --> 00:18:21,260
Has a man never kissed you...

179
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:26,032
<i>Caressed the soft curves
of your hips...</i>

180
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,538
Slipped inside of you...

181
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:36,676
Domina has seen me
remain untouched.

182
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:42,448
Then we are both...

183
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:45,651
In her debt.

184
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:10,443
<i>You give her away
as if a common whore!</i>

185
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,845
<i>I've preserved her chastity
since she was a child,</i>

186
00:19:12,913 --> 00:19:14,413
towards presenting it as gift!

187
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:17,083
The only gift of chastity
is in its removal.

188
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,884
<i>By a man of worth!</i>

189
00:19:18,952 --> 00:19:21,454
Not fucking ashur!

190
00:19:24,124 --> 00:19:27,226
Naevia has been
my most trusted slave.

191
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:30,463
The thought of that
fucking syrian

192
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,366
shoving his devious
cock inside her...

193
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,034
It's a betrayal, quintus.

194
00:19:35,102 --> 00:19:36,736
It is a necessity.

195
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:38,971
Set details of it aside,
and shift mind

196
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,040
to Glaber's arrival.

197
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:43,542
His patronage brings to climax

198
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,910
all our labors.

199
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:49,148
When the sun rises
on the House of Batiatus...

200
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,551
Everything will change.

201
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,176
<i>Your wooden man gives
almost as much fight as Solonius.</i>

202
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,214
With each victory,

203
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:57,783
I draw closer to facing
you again in the arena.

204
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:00,920
And reclaiming stolen glories.

205
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:03,055
There is no glory.

206
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:04,957
<i>Only blood.</i>

207
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:07,226
Spilled for the pleasure
of the romans.

208
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:09,261
And how they shall roar,

209
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:11,697
when I spill your blood
upon the sands.

210
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,101
<i>Spartacus!</i>

211
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:17,269
You are summoned.

212
00:21:24,211 --> 00:21:25,744
I fear you will never
have the chance.

213
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,587
<i>Watch what
you're fucking doing!</i>

214
00:21:35,956 --> 00:21:37,189
<i>Fuck.</i>

215
00:21:37,257 --> 00:21:38,457
<i>Be careful with that!</i>

216
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:39,625
Dominus.

217
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:42,061
Where are the flowers?

218
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:45,564
Go find the new girl
and bring fucking flowers!

219
00:21:45,632 --> 00:21:48,300
A house full of slaves, have to
do fucking everything myself.

220
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:51,637
Ah! The Champion of
Capua graces us

221
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:53,739
<i>with his presence!</i>

222
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:55,741
Apologies for not
receiving you sooner.

223
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,179
I have been consumed with
the tumult of recent events.

224
00:22:02,616 --> 00:22:03,716
Much has changed.

225
00:22:05,085 --> 00:22:08,120
The world reforms at our feet,

226
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:09,722
the very earth thrusting us

227
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:10,890
to unimaginable heights!

228
00:22:16,129 --> 00:22:17,563
At great cost.

229
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:18,764
<i>Easily paid!</i>

230
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:21,901
At this very moment
Legatus Glaber

231
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:24,169
thunders towards us
to bestow patronage.

232
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:27,006
I know your feelings
towards the man.

233
00:22:28,408 --> 00:22:30,075
<i>I would ask that
they be put aside,</i>

234
00:22:30,143 --> 00:22:33,445
<i>in favor of more
Noble pursuits.</i>

235
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:38,017
Glaber took Sura from my arms.

236
00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:42,621
But he is not the man
that took her life.

237
00:22:48,762 --> 00:22:49,862
<i>Aurelia?</i>

238
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:55,568
Would that be all?

239
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,570
Yep, fine, leave.

240
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,638
What is she doing here?

241
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:02,508
Working beneath my employ,
to pay off varro's debts.

242
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:04,410
I pledged my winnings
to such a cause.

243
00:23:04,477 --> 00:23:07,279
<i>You did not tell her this?
Of course.</i>

244
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:08,981
She would have
no coin from your purse,

245
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:11,283
<i>nor mine, unless
it was obtained</i>

246
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:13,819
<i>by means of fair labor.</i>

247
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:15,621
<i>She wishes to serve
the House of Batiatus,</i>

248
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:17,423
<i>until all his debts
are balanced.</i>

249
00:23:19,326 --> 00:23:21,493
She is a good woman.

250
00:23:21,561 --> 00:23:23,495
<i>And worthy of consideration.</i>

251
00:23:23,563 --> 00:23:25,397
<i>And she shall receive
it in abundance.</i>

252
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:27,499
Now tell me, what
matter were ywu so eager

253
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:28,834
to discuss with me?

254
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,505
I merely sought word
towards varro's wife,

255
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:35,107
<i>and that she had
been provided for.</i>

256
00:23:38,845 --> 00:23:39,778
Excellent!

257
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:42,815
<i>So all is well
between us.</i>

258
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:54,259
I require words with Spartacus.

259
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:58,430
Why the fuck
would I allow that?

260
00:23:58,498 --> 00:23:59,999
Because my tongue
remains silent

261
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:02,067
towards the Gate key you lost.

262
00:24:02,135 --> 00:24:04,069
You would have it remain so?

263
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:06,438
Be quick.

264
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,681
Opportunity presents itself,
yet Batiatus lives.

265
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:17,416
For the moment.

266
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:19,952
Last night the lives
of every slave

267
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,554
under this roof
meant nothing to you.

268
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:24,823
Then aurelia appears,
and you grow a conscience!

269
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:26,492
Varro was as a brother.

270
00:24:27,994 --> 00:24:30,129
I will not see his
wife put at risk.

271
00:24:30,196 --> 00:24:32,498
You put the woman at risk
when you killed her husband.

272
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,650
<i>Crixus!</i>

273
00:24:57,323 --> 00:24:58,424
A parting gift.

274
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,727
What is this shit?

275
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:06,231
A memento of your
battle with Theokoles.

276
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,233
<i>The city was filled
with such novelties</i>

277
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:10,436
<i>after Spartacus
brought the rains.</i>

278
00:25:12,072 --> 00:25:13,605
The craftsmanship
was rather poor.

279
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:15,741
Dominus finally
decides to remove you

280
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:17,242
from the company of men?

281
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,744
Far removed.

282
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:23,749
I have been given favored
quarters within the villa.

283
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:26,318
To serve as our
master's right hand.

284
00:25:27,754 --> 00:25:29,755
The one he wipes his ass with.

285
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:32,458
Ah, a witty turn of phrase.

286
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:34,259
One of many splendors
I shall miss

287
00:25:34,327 --> 00:25:36,328
of being a gladiator.

288
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:37,996
You were never a gladiator.

289
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:43,736
No.

290
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:46,105
Not after your blade
found itself in my leg.

291
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:49,675
My gift to you.

292
00:25:50,877 --> 00:25:52,678
One that has
given great reward.

293
00:25:59,252 --> 00:26:00,385
Everything I am,

294
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:04,156
everything I now possess,
I owe to you.

295
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:17,202
No, that goes to the balcony.

296
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,371
Quickly, the Legatus arrives.

297
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,373
The new girl is slow
to the task.

298
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:23,242
An act of charity.

299
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:25,911
We shall yet find
proper use for her.

300
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:28,313
A great day, Dominus.

301
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:29,982
One that shall be remembered.

302
00:26:37,123 --> 00:26:38,056
Where is the Legatus?

303
00:26:38,124 --> 00:26:40,592
Apologies.
My husband is delayed.

304
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,961
But you made promise.

305
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:44,530
Which will be well kept.

306
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:47,065
He yet intends proper visit,

307
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:49,668
but requests good
Batiatus give greeting

308
00:26:49,736 --> 00:26:51,804
upon entering the city.

309
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:53,238
A great honor!

310
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:54,740
When does he arrive?

311
00:26:54,808 --> 00:26:55,908
Now.

312
00:26:58,278 --> 00:26:59,378
We must hurry!

313
00:27:02,949 --> 00:27:04,650
<i>Come.</i>

314
00:27:04,717 --> 00:27:06,985
Let us retire to
the balcony to feast.

315
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:09,354
And review your
sense of timing.

316
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:11,657
I would love nothing more,

317
00:27:11,724 --> 00:27:14,393
but I must return to the villa

318
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,727
<i>to gather
my belongings.</i>

319
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:18,230
To what end?

320
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:20,032
I'm moving back to Rome!

321
00:27:22,402 --> 00:27:25,304
But your stay in Capua
has been so brief.

322
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:27,039
Painfully.

323
00:27:27,106 --> 00:27:29,541
Yet now that my husband
campaigns for praetor,

324
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:32,044
he insists I remain
at his side.

325
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:35,614
Are you well?

326
00:27:35,682 --> 00:27:37,616
The blood drains
from your cheeks.

327
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:41,720
My heart but flutters at the...

328
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:43,188
The thought of losing you.

329
00:27:45,525 --> 00:27:47,259
Memories of our
time together will

330
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:49,962
fade only with difficulty.

331
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:54,233
Your friendship, lucretia,

332
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,235
has forever altered my life.

333
00:28:21,628 --> 00:28:23,562
Spartacus.

334
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,897
I would make request.

335
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:28,667
Ask another,
if you seek it granted.

336
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:31,336
It is not for me,
but for my brother.

337
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,978
Batiatus orders us parted.

338
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:42,314
Duro greets the news
with laugh and fucking smile.

339
00:28:42,382 --> 00:28:45,884
Yet I fear he shall not
survive the arena on his own.

340
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,053
You are not alone
in the thought.

341
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:51,256
Batiatus shows you much favor.

342
00:28:51,324 --> 00:28:53,625
A word from your lips could
see the decision undone.

343
00:28:55,228 --> 00:28:57,529
Batiatus favors
no one but himself.

344
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:26,692
<i>Yeah!
The Legatus!</i>

345
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:38,937
Legatus Glaber!

346
00:29:39,005 --> 00:29:41,540
Your arrival honors
the fair city of Capua!

347
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:45,444
An honor I expected matched
by greeting at the Gate.

348
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:46,878
Well apologies.
I had thought that..

349
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:49,414
Let us move past it.

350
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:51,750
My ears burn with
reports of lawlessness

351
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:53,385
<i>since last I visited.</i>

352
00:29:53,453 --> 00:29:55,587
The Magistrate's murder
was unfortunate...

353
00:29:55,655 --> 00:29:57,856
As was that of Ovidius
and his family.

354
00:29:57,924 --> 00:30:00,492
<i>And now the cousin
of senator crassus</i>

355
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,461
<i>goes missing.</i>

356
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:04,296
Let us retire to my villa,
and we can discuss these

357
00:30:04,364 --> 00:30:05,697
and other matters at length.

358
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:08,133
I prefer to speak with
someone in authority.

359
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:09,601
<i>Good mercato awaits.</i>

360
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:10,969
I shall accompany you?

361
00:30:11,037 --> 00:30:12,404
That won't be necessary.

362
00:30:12,472 --> 00:30:14,172
Await me at your villa.

363
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,307
When shall I expect you?

364
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,475
When I arrive.

365
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:23,582
<i>Crixus!
You are summoned.</i>

366
00:30:25,852 --> 00:30:27,853
I long for the night,
to continue

367
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,988
what was last interrupted.

368
00:30:30,056 --> 00:30:31,323
I cannot meet you.

369
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:34,860
Tis but one night.

370
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:36,461
There's no cause for this.

371
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:39,264
Yes, cause.

372
00:30:39,332 --> 00:30:41,600
<i>Enough to drown us
both in tears.</i>

373
00:30:46,172 --> 00:30:47,939
Dominus has given me
to another.

374
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,779
Who? Tell me his name!

375
00:30:55,681 --> 00:30:56,715
What does it matter?

376
00:30:56,783 --> 00:30:58,216
We have lived in a dream.

377
00:30:58,284 --> 00:30:59,885
And now we must awaken.

378
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:08,760
<i>Do not be troubled,
mighty Crixus.</i>

379
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:13,465
Capua cheers your
name once more.

380
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:17,436
<i>Soon you will seize
the mantle of champion</i>

381
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:19,071
<i>from that
fucking Thracian.</i>

382
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:22,140
And everything
shall be as it was

383
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,176
before you fell to Theokoles.

384
00:31:25,711 --> 00:31:27,979
I long for it to be so.

385
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:30,615
As do I.

386
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,793
Something's wrong...

387
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,230
Apologies, Domina.

388
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:51,636
Naevia!

389
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:01,146
The shit fuck beckons
me to the city,

390
00:32:01,214 --> 00:32:03,248
only to spurn me
like a thin wasted whore!

391
00:32:03,316 --> 00:32:05,984
Once again the gods
spread the cheeks

392
00:32:06,052 --> 00:32:09,087
to ram cock in fucking ass!

393
00:32:09,155 --> 00:32:11,823
Perhaps a gentle nudge,
to remind the Legatus

394
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:12,958
of your importance...?

395
00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:14,726
Hmm, make the arrangements.

396
00:32:14,794 --> 00:32:17,762
Glaber will bend
to my fucking will.

397
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,831
Or break in the denying of it.

398
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:20,999
Lucretia!

399
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:23,034
You need to have fucking
words with Ilithyia...

400
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,005
What's happened?

401
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:30,408
I am with child.

402
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:34,713
You're to be a father, quintus.

403
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:40,652
Well, wine!

404
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,053
Wine for the fucking house, eh!

405
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:43,221
We must celebrate!

406
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:47,058
<i>We must celebrate.</i>

407
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,333
<i>This fucking village.</i>

408
00:32:57,904 --> 00:32:59,471
Finally.

409
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:01,540
I had feared you
absorbed for the night.

410
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:04,242
The curse of mercato's
incompetence.

411
00:33:05,978 --> 00:33:07,312
Cousin of crassus vanishes,

412
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,682
and no theory rattles around
in his empty head.

413
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,551
Theories pale
against the obvious.

414
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:15,787
Licinia's tongue was
suspected of lounging

415
00:33:15,855 --> 00:33:17,556
in less esteemed places than

416
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:19,224
<i>around her
husband's cock...</i>

417
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,028
Whereas mine has made
do with naught

418
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:25,330
but idle conversation.

419
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:29,768
I fear it may not
have been as idle

420
00:33:29,835 --> 00:33:31,469
as you would have me believe.

421
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:35,840
What promises have
you made Batiatus

422
00:33:35,908 --> 00:33:37,108
and his faded bitch?

423
00:33:37,176 --> 00:33:40,178
The flesh monger looks
to me with rheumy eyes,

424
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:42,547
brimming with expectation.

425
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:46,885
I promise nothing,
save word on their behalf

426
00:33:46,953 --> 00:33:51,389
to my dearly missed husband...

427
00:33:52,525 --> 00:33:55,327
Batiatus is little better

428
00:33:55,394 --> 00:33:57,896
than the beasts
that bear his mark.

429
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:03,268
True, but they do provide
a certain amusement.

430
00:34:08,207 --> 00:34:09,574
Humor their intent.

431
00:34:10,977 --> 00:34:13,144
No more can be asked from
a man of your station.

432
00:34:16,749 --> 00:34:20,819
My promise discharged,
and we shall return to Rome.

433
00:34:20,886 --> 00:34:23,521
And more civilized company.

434
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:46,044
Fetch another.

435
00:34:47,146 --> 00:34:48,280
<i>And hold
onto it this time.</i>

436
00:34:53,653 --> 00:34:54,753
<i>Aurelia.</i>

437
00:34:55,855 --> 00:34:57,122
I beg a moment.

438
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:00,692
Alone.

439
00:35:06,165 --> 00:35:07,932
You cannot be under
the care of Batiatus.

440
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,234
The deed is done.

441
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:11,503
Then I shall see it undone.

442
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,737
My winnings in the arena...

443
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:14,072
Are not fucking wanted.

444
00:35:16,008 --> 00:35:18,109
Varro asked that
I see you taken care of.

445
00:35:18,177 --> 00:35:19,778
Then return him to me.

446
00:35:26,252 --> 00:35:27,285
Varro's son.

447
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:30,789
<i>He is safe?</i>

448
00:35:30,856 --> 00:35:33,058
He stays with my brother.

449
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,327
To be raised free
of his father's debt.

450
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:36,494
Absent his mother.

451
00:35:39,198 --> 00:35:41,132
What of the child in carry?

452
00:35:44,036 --> 00:35:45,837
It was not fathered by varro.

453
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:50,175
Without him I...

454
00:35:55,181 --> 00:35:57,215
I had it removed
from my concerns.

455
00:35:58,718 --> 00:36:00,018
As I would be from yours.

456
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:04,255
Batiatus is not to be trusted.

457
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,425
Do not lay faith in him.

458
00:36:07,493 --> 00:36:10,228
My husband is dead.

459
00:36:10,296 --> 00:36:12,497
And with him all faith.

460
00:36:21,374 --> 00:36:23,875
<i>As your eyes witness,
no coin has been spared</i>

461
00:36:23,943 --> 00:36:25,143
<i>in restoring the villa!</i>

462
00:36:25,211 --> 00:36:28,079
All will marvel upon
privileged entry,

463
00:36:28,147 --> 00:36:30,181
and be humbled by
the storied history

464
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:31,616
of the House of Batiatus!

465
00:36:31,684 --> 00:36:33,385
It is a vast improvement.

466
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:36,554
Hm, the gods have
truly blessed them.

467
00:36:36,622 --> 00:36:38,556
And continue to do so.

468
00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:41,192
If fortune so favors,
why do you continue

469
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,561
to press so brazenly
for my support?

470
00:36:43,629 --> 00:36:45,397
True fortune extends
no further than

471
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:46,798
a man's ambitions.

472
00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:49,467
Mine stretch well beyond
the sands of the arena.

473
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,036
How far beyond?

474
00:36:52,104 --> 00:36:54,372
To the very doors
of political office.

475
00:36:56,876 --> 00:36:58,676
In a minor capacity.
At first.

476
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:03,481
Well, let us entertain
it for a moment.

477
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:06,251
What men of status
lend you their confidence?

478
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:09,354
Magistrate Calavius had
voiced his endorsement.

479
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:12,724
Before the coward Solonius
forever stilled his tongue.

480
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:13,992
<i>Base villain.</i>

481
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:16,728
The way he would
stare with his teeth.

482
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:21,566
<i>My heart is moved
by the tragedy.</i>

483
00:37:21,634 --> 00:37:23,501
Yet my head remains fixed.

484
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:27,405
What advantage would
I gain by association

485
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:29,774
with a lanista?

486
00:37:29,842 --> 00:37:32,544
My gladiators ignite
the passion of the crowd.

487
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:36,214
Lend name to my cause,
and see their deafening cheers

488
00:37:36,282 --> 00:37:39,784
transformed into demands
for claudius Glaber,

489
00:37:39,852 --> 00:37:43,721
and his desired
position of praetor.

490
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:51,463
They do favor batiatu"
men like no others.

491
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:54,232
Especially Spartacus.

492
00:37:57,636 --> 00:37:58,736
The Thracian.

493
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,373
And what does it say that
your finest gladiator

494
00:38:02,441 --> 00:38:03,708
was my worst soldier?

495
00:38:05,511 --> 00:38:07,946
That I am the greatest
lanista in the Republic.

496
00:38:08,013 --> 00:38:09,347
<i>For I have taken
a wild beast,</i>

497
00:38:09,415 --> 00:38:11,216
<i>and forged him
into a God.</i>

498
00:38:11,283 --> 00:38:12,550
Its a bold claim.

499
00:38:13,853 --> 00:38:16,087
Built on a foundation
of fucking granite.

500
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:19,023
I would see your
words made flesh.

501
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:20,492
Easily conjured.

502
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,360
Spartacus trains in the square
with the other men.

503
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:23,728
<i>I have descended
into the bowels</i>

504
00:38:23,796 --> 00:38:26,564
of your Ludus once before,
and did not care for the stench.

505
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,200
Summon the Thracian
to the villa,

506
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:30,535
along with the rest
of your men.

507
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:34,105
All of them?

508
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:35,273
All of them.

509
00:38:56,529 --> 00:38:58,596
<i>The Champion of Capua.</i>

510
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:03,201
A sad day when an honored
city elevates a cur

511
00:39:03,269 --> 00:39:05,136
to such position.

512
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:13,011
I see you've taught the animal
not to speak out of turn.

513
00:39:15,748 --> 00:39:17,916
And I would have demonstration
of other tricks

514
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:19,250
the Thracian has learned.

515
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,320
Unchain him.

516
00:39:32,765 --> 00:39:34,732
Which of my men would
you have oppose him?

517
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,900
None.

518
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:38,469
Formation.

519
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:51,649
Spartacus
wields practice swords.

520
00:39:51,717 --> 00:39:54,218
I fear he's at a disadvantage.

521
00:39:54,286 --> 00:39:56,988
I but give him chance
to prove his legend.

522
00:39:58,624 --> 00:39:59,724
Iovis.

523
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:12,236
How exciting.

524
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:15,273
Begin!

525
00:40:37,796 --> 00:40:39,464
Vesper! Linus!

526
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,333
Legatus...

527
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:43,568
You opened this door, lanista.

528
00:40:43,636 --> 00:40:45,069
And we shall pass through it.

529
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,640
Behold.

530
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,208
The legend is proved.

531
00:43:06,812 --> 00:43:07,912
Dominus.

532
00:43:10,415 --> 00:43:12,350
This savage caused
Rome great offense!

533
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:16,988
Yet it would appear that
you have broken the man.

534
00:43:19,258 --> 00:43:21,425
The way he bows
his head in deference.

535
00:43:23,295 --> 00:43:25,663
<i>Would I be afforded such
courtesies, I wonder,</i>

536
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:28,966
<i>if patronage
were awarded?</i>

537
00:43:29,034 --> 00:43:32,003
He would be yours to command,
as would all my men.

538
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,008
Kneel.

539
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:38,309
<i>And it shall be so.</i>

540
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:54,458
Legatus.

541
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:36,834
Crixus!

542
00:44:36,902 --> 00:44:38,469
You fucking cunt!

543
00:44:42,975 --> 00:44:44,709
Calm yourself!

544
00:44:44,776 --> 00:44:45,977
Slaves running wild!

545
00:44:46,044 --> 00:44:47,745
This is what you would
have me give name towards?

546
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:51,649
What seizes your
fucking wits? Speak!

547
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:55,019
I yet but touch my gift,
and Crixus goes mad.

548
00:44:56,388 --> 00:44:59,590
I felt her maidenhood long
absent when we lay together.

549
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:02,426
<i>Now I know whose cock
was in her first.</i>

550
00:45:08,934 --> 00:45:10,768
<i>You whore!</i>

551
00:45:10,836 --> 00:45:11,769
<i>How long?</i>

552
00:45:11,837 --> 00:45:13,604
How fucking long?

553
00:45:14,907 --> 00:45:16,007
How long have you
hidden laughter

554
00:45:16,074 --> 00:45:17,341
behind a polite smile!

555
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:20,811
How long have you
been luring him

556
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:23,314
to your filthy slave cunt?

557
00:45:29,187 --> 00:45:31,656
What is it?
What is it?

558
00:45:31,723 --> 00:45:33,858
Give it to me.
Give it to me!

559
00:45:37,863 --> 00:45:39,497
How did you come by it?

560
00:45:39,564 --> 00:45:40,665
I took it.

561
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,168
To open the Gate.
So you could lie with Crixus.

562
00:45:46,138 --> 00:45:48,906
You alone knew
of my feelings for him.

563
00:45:48,974 --> 00:45:51,175
And yet you betray me.

564
00:45:57,082 --> 00:45:59,317
Crixus never loved you.

565
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:00,751
He did only as commanded.

566
00:46:10,362 --> 00:46:11,462
Mira!

567
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:14,332
Domina.

568
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:19,737
Bring me a knife.

569
00:46:24,876 --> 00:46:27,411
You have assurance
Crixus will be punished.

570
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:29,714
I fear your hands
too soft for the task.

571
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:33,184
You are mistaken.
They are as steel,

572
00:46:33,251 --> 00:46:35,252
hardened to their purpose.

573
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,054
<i>As I to mine.</i>

574
00:46:37,122 --> 00:46:38,622
<i>We return
to Rome, absent</i>

575
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:39,924
unworthy entanglements.

576
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:41,959
Do not turn from me!

577
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:43,995
You forget your place, lanista!

578
00:46:44,062 --> 00:46:45,329
No. I secure it.

579
00:46:46,631 --> 00:46:47,965
Clear the fucking room!

580
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:50,768
Tell ashur to bring our
gift for the Legatus!

581
00:46:52,437 --> 00:46:53,537
Forget your gifts.

582
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,108
I would part as from
a troubling dream,

583
00:46:57,175 --> 00:46:58,709
untethered by the memory of it.

584
00:46:58,777 --> 00:46:59,910
Oh you will remember this day.

585
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:03,147
Until you lay to
slumber, never to awaken.

586
00:47:03,215 --> 00:47:06,117
I fear we have let
events run the best of us.

587
00:47:06,184 --> 00:47:08,786
Perhaps a cup of wine
to er, cool the head.

588
00:47:08,854 --> 00:47:12,056
We are long past
civilized recourse.

589
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:14,792
Your husband presses issue.
I would see it closed.

590
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,960
As would I.

591
00:47:18,263 --> 00:47:20,898
Can I believe this will
make a difference?

592
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,233
Open it and see.

593
00:47:30,308 --> 00:47:32,410
What is this abomination?

594
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:34,912
But a piece of the whole.

595
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,213
Licinia.

596
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:37,381
<i>Cousin of crassus.</i>

597
00:47:39,084 --> 00:47:41,152
You murdered licinia?

598
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:43,888
No. Your wife did.

599
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:46,023
He lies.

600
00:47:46,091 --> 00:47:47,625
<i>A most heinous act.</i>

601
00:47:47,692 --> 00:47:49,360
One I was content
to help obscure,

602
00:47:49,428 --> 00:47:52,463
under promise of her aid
in obtaining your favor.

603
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,167
<i>Now I fear licinia's
body may resurface.</i>

604
00:47:57,569 --> 00:47:59,437
On the grounds
of your villa, perhaps?

605
00:48:00,772 --> 00:48:03,107
I will see the tongue ripped
from your fucking mouth!

606
00:48:03,175 --> 00:48:05,509
Even so ruined, it would
yet speak the truth.

607
00:48:06,912 --> 00:48:08,679
<i>Cladius.</i>

608
00:48:08,747 --> 00:48:10,881
You cannot believe me
capable of such a thing.

609
00:48:29,334 --> 00:48:31,569
Patronage is granted.

610
00:48:31,636 --> 00:48:33,737
<i>A portion of my men
will remain stationed</i>

611
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:37,508
against further embarrassments.

612
00:48:40,312 --> 00:48:42,847
Make all other arrangements
with Ilithyia.

613
00:48:42,914 --> 00:48:45,116
<i>She will be remaining
here in Capua.</i>

614
00:48:45,183 --> 00:48:46,283
No!

615
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,275
No man is above retribution

616
00:49:11,343 --> 00:49:12,510
for offenses committed

617
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:15,112
against the House of Batiatus.

618
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,814
<i>No gladiator.</i>

619
00:49:16,882 --> 00:49:17,982
<i>No champion.</i>

620
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:20,684
Even the men that guard you,

621
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:25,389
should they be guilty
of deceit or incompetence.

622
00:49:26,525 --> 00:49:28,125
<i>Hector found
his key removed.</i>

623
00:49:28,193 --> 00:49:29,326
His head follows.

624
00:49:31,796 --> 00:49:33,831
<i>The fault lies
in my own breast,</i>

625
00:49:33,899 --> 00:49:35,933
with heart grown too large.

626
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,069
<i>This cannot stand.</i>

627
00:49:39,137 --> 00:49:41,639
Legatus claudius Glaber

628
00:49:41,706 --> 00:49:43,741
<i>is now our honored patron.</i>

629
00:49:43,808 --> 00:49:47,611
And he has opened my eyes
to the error of my generosity.

630
00:49:49,548 --> 00:49:51,048
<i>One that demands
correction.</i>

631
00:49:57,722 --> 00:49:59,723
Embrace the pain.

632
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:01,392
It is the only way.

633
00:50:56,715 --> 00:50:59,316
I expect your meetings
with Crixus to end.

634
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,587
Quintus...

635
00:51:03,655 --> 00:51:05,522
Do not fucking speak.

636
00:51:08,293 --> 00:51:11,228
That you would think
me a fool is insult enough.

637
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:16,967
I have always known.

638
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:19,136
<i>And turned eye away only
because it made you happy,</i>

639
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,804
and caused me no thought.

640
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,008
Those days have ended.

641
00:51:26,511 --> 00:51:28,846
Set your attentions
towards our child.

642
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:31,682
And do not see them stray.

643
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:32,850
Enough!

644
00:51:51,803 --> 00:51:52,903
<i>Crixus!</i>

645
00:51:54,572 --> 00:51:55,673
<i>Crixus!</i>

646
00:51:57,676 --> 00:51:59,143
Grant them a moment.

647
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:01,145
He was our champion once.

648
00:52:01,212 --> 00:52:02,479
Allow him such respect.

649
00:52:16,194 --> 00:52:18,195
I have destroyed us.

650
00:52:20,765 --> 00:52:21,865
We yet live.

651
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:24,635
Where do they take you?

652
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,470
I do not know.

653
00:52:29,874 --> 00:52:32,343
I will win my freedom.

654
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,712
I will not rest
until I find you.

655
00:52:35,847 --> 00:52:36,947
It is time.

656
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:48,025
He speaks of freedom,
as did Barca.

657
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:50,728
I give you my word, that I shall
aid him in the seeking of it.

658
00:52:50,795 --> 00:52:53,630
No. You must not let
him broach the subject.

659
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,267
Barca was not freed.

660
00:52:58,703 --> 00:53:00,137
Batiatus took his life.

661
00:53:11,149 --> 00:53:13,050
Fuck ass, you Roman cock.

662
00:53:16,287 --> 00:53:17,554
Shut your fucking mouth.

663
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,591
I would caution softer words.

664
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:24,561
The shit keeps rising higher
in this fucking hole.

665
00:53:25,864 --> 00:53:27,731
Perhaps it best
not to be present,

666
00:53:27,799 --> 00:53:29,700
when it fills the mouth.

667
00:53:33,238 --> 00:53:34,905
What do you speak of?

668
00:53:34,973 --> 00:53:36,240
I speak of nothing.

669
00:53:38,109 --> 00:53:40,244
Nothing sounds
much like escape.

670
00:53:42,213 --> 00:53:44,681
<i>And how would "nothing"
find way past Batiatus</i>

671
00:53:44,749 --> 00:53:46,049
<i>and all his fucking romans?</i>

672
00:53:48,887 --> 00:53:50,487
There is but one path.

673
00:53:52,724 --> 00:53:53,991
We kill them all.

674
