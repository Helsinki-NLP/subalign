1
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,615
Onward, Ohauncey!

2
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,349
To the highest room
of the tallest tower...

3
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:03,588
...where my princess awaits rescue
from her handsome Prince Oharming!

4
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,707
This is worse than " Love Letters" .
I hate dinner theater!

5
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,608
Me, too.

6
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,939
Whoa there, Ohauncey!

7
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,809
Hark! The brave Prince Oharming
approacheth.

8
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:33,324
Fear not, fair maiden. I shall slay
the monster that guards you...

9
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,395
...then take my place as rightful king.

10
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,121
What did she say?

11
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,300
It's Shrek!

12
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,231
Whoo, Shrek, yeah!

13
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,567
Prepare, foul beast...

14
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:54,373
...to enter into a world of pain
with which you are not familiar!

15
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,074
<i>Happy birthday to thee</i>
<i>Happy birthday to thee</i>

16
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,479
Do you mind?

17
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,981
Do you mind? Boring!

18
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,825
Prepare, foul beast...

19
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,533
Someday you'll be sorry.

20
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,834
We already are!

21
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,264
Mommy...

22
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,698
You're right. I can't let this happen.

23
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,875
I can't !

24
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,812
I am the rightful King of Far Far Away.

25
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,043
And I promise you this, Mother...

26
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,116
...I will restore dignity to my throne.

27
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:14,818
And this time,

28
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:19,125
no one will stand in my way.

29
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,743
Good morning.

30
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,412
Good morning.

31
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,112
Morning breath.

32
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,419
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

33
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,924
<i>Good morning, good morning</i>

34
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,996
<i>The sun is shining through</i>

35
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,326
<i>Good morning, good morning</i>
<i>To you</i>

36
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,594
<i>And you!</i>
<i>And you!</i>

37
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,201
They grow up so fast.

38
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,435
Not fast enough.

39
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,208
You'll be filling in
for the King and Queen.

40
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,546
Several functions
require your attendance, sir.

41
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,984
Great! Let's get started.

42
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,955
Oome on, lazybones. Time to get moving!

43
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,056
You need to get a pair ofjammies.

44
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,733
<i>I got some sleep and I needed it</i>

45
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,602
<i>Not a lot, just a little bit</i>

46
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,836
<i>Someone's always</i>
<i>trying to keep me from it</i>

47
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,811
<i>It's a crying shame</i>

48
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,848
<i>It's a royal pain in the neck</i>

49
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,645
I knight thee.

50
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,636
If you're filling in for a king,
you should look like one.

51
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,838
Oan somebody come in
and work on Shrek?

52
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,173
I will see what I can do.

53
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,033
Yeah, wow.

54
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,365
Is this really necessary?

55
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,805
Quite necessary, Fiona.

56
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,744
- I'm Shrek, you twit.
- Whatever.

57
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,579
This isn't a rehearsal, peoples.
Let's see some hustle!

58
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,654
Smiles, everyone! Smiles!

59
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,246
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

60
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,327
I'm sorry, but can you
just try to grin and bear it?

61
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,487
It's just until Dad gets better.

62
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,897
Shrek?

63
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,827
You look handsome.

64
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,904
Oome here, you.

65
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:31,917
My butt is itching up a storm and
I can't reach it in this monkey suit.

66
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,694
Hey, you! Oome here. What's your name?

67
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,194
Fiddlesworth, sir.

68
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,423
Perfect.

69
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,467
Ladies and gentlemen...

70
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,767
...Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek!

71
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,874
Ahh! You've got it.

72
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,537
A little to the left.

73
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,978
That's it! That's good.

74
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,212
Oh, yeah! Scratch
that thing! You're on it.

75
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,788
Shrek!

76
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:09,820
My eye!

77
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,122
What are you doing?

78
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,692
Fiona!

79
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,039
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

80
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,980
Shrimp! My favorite!

81
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,190
- That's it! We're leaving!
- Oalm down.

82
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,267
Oalm down? Who do you think
we're kidding? I am an ogre.

83
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,997
I'm not cut out for this, Fiona,
and I never will be.

84
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,441
I think that went well.

85
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,806
Donkey!

86
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,675
Oome on, Shrek!

87
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,412
Some people just don't
understand boundaries.

88
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:19,290
Just think. A couple more days
and we'll be back home...

89
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,731
...in our vermin-filled shack
strewn with fungus...

90
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,770
...and filled with the stench
of mud and neglect.

91
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,533
You had me at "vermin-filled" .

92
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:34,210
And, um... maybe even the pitter-patter
of little feet on the floor.

93
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,410
That's right, the swamp rats
will be spawning.

94
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,915
Uh, no.

95
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,748
What I'm thinking of is a little bigger
than a swamp rat.

96
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,913
Donkey?

97
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,719
No, Shrek. What if, theoretically...

98
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,122
...they were little ogre feet?

99
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,937
Honey, let's be rational about this.

100
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,439
Have you seen a baby lately?

101
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,773
They just eat and poop, and they cry...

102
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:10,280
...then they cry when they poop
and poop when they cry.

103
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,214
Now, imagine an ogre baby.

104
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:17,152
They extra-cry and they extra-poop.

105
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,885
Shrek, don't you ever think
about having a family?

106
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,588
Right now, you're my family.

107
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,762
Somebody better be dying.

108
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,935
I'm dying.

109
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,436
Harold?

110
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,707
Don't forget
to pay the gardener, Lillian.

111
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,783
Of course, darling.

112
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,578
Fiona.

113
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,245
Yes, Daddy?

114
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,119
I know I made many mistakes with you.

115
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,593
It's okay.

116
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,855
But your love for Shrek has...

117
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,197
...taught me much.

118
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,326
My dear boy...

119
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,735
...I am proud to call you my son.

120
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,001
And I'm proud to call you my frog...

121
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,577
...King dad-in-law.

122
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:19,310
Now there is a matter
of business to attend to.

123
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,654
The Frog King... is dead.

124
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,808
Put your hat back on, fool.

125
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,534
Shrek...

126
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,338
...please come hither.

127
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,547
Yeah, Dad?

128
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,847
This kingdom needs a new king.

129
00:10:56,188 --> 00:11:00,852
You and Fiona
are next in line for the throne.

130
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:06,726
Next in line. You see, Dad,
that's why people love you.

131
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:10,199
Even on your deathbed,
you're still making jokes.

132
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,570
Oome on, Dad. An ogre as king?

133
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,235
That's not such a good idea.

134
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,678
There must be somebody else. Anybody!

135
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:29,015
Aside from you, there is
only one remaining heir.

136
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,352
Really? Who is he, Dad?

137
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,550
His name is...

138
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:36,986
...is...

139
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,756
What's his name?

140
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,490
...is...

141
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,493
Daddy!

142
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,721
His name is Arthur.

143
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,254
Arthur?

144
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,791
I know you'll do...

145
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,593
...what's right.

146
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:18,967
Harold?

147
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,663
Dad? Dad!

148
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,336
Dad?

149
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,535
Do your thing, man.

150
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:59,342
<i>When you were young and your heart</i>

151
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,639
<i>Was an open book</i>

152
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:07,779
<i>y ou used to say live and let live</i>

153
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,253
<i>y ou know you did, you know you did</i>
<i>y ou know you did</i>

154
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:17,120
<i>But if this ever changing world</i>
<i>In which we live in</i>

155
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:22,161
<i>Makes you give in and cry</i>

156
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,831
<i>Say live and let die</i>

157
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,937
<i>Live and let die</i>

158
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,213
<i>Hey, lady</i>
<i>y ou, lady</i>

159
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,380
<i>Cursing at your life</i>

160
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,717
<i>y ou're a discontented mother</i>

161
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,054
<i>And a regimented wife</i>

162
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,917
What does a prince
have to do to get a drink here?

163
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,954
Ah, Mabel!

164
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:59,497
Why they call you an ugly stepsister,
I'll never know.

165
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,693
Where's Doris? Taking the night off?

166
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,602
She's not welcome here,
and neither are you.

167
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,300
What do you want, Oharming?

168
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:15,504
Not much. Just a chance at redemption.

169
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,583
And a Fuzzy Navel.

170
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,777
And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!

171
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,852
We're not your friends.

172
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,189
You don't belong here.

173
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:36,495
You're absolutely right,
but, I mean, do any of us?

174
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,262
Do a number on his face.

175
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:43,000
Wait, wait, wait!
We are more alike than you think.

176
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:47,044
Wicked Witch! The Seven Dwarfs
saved Snow White, and what happened?

177
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,271
Oh, what's it to you?

178
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,678
They left you the unfairest of them all.

179
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:55,344
Now here you are,
hustling pool to get your next meal.

180
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,318
How does that feel?

181
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,387
Pretty unfair.

182
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,929
And you!

183
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:10,695
Your star puppet abandons the show
to go and find his father.

184
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,297
I hate that little wooden puppet.

185
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,408
And Hook.

186
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,134
Need I say more?

187
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,611
- And you, Frumpypigskin!
- Rumpelstiltskin.

188
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,378
Where's that firstborn
you were promised?

189
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:33,690
Mabel. Remember how you
couldn't get your little fat foot...

190
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,726
...into that tiny glass slipper?

191
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,924
Oinderella is
in Far Far Away right now...

192
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:47,095
...eating bonbons, cavorting with
every last fairy tale creature...

193
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,707
...that has ever done you wrong!

194
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:54,779
Once upon a time, someone decided
that we were the losers.

195
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,780
But there are
two sides to every story...

196
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,475
...and our side has not been told!

197
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:05,488
So who will join me? Who wants
to come out on top for once?

198
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,285
Who wants their...

199
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,589
..." happily ever after" ?

200
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,441
This way, gents.

201
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:45,821
It's out of my hands, <i>senorita</i>. The
winds of fate have blown on my destiny.

202
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,764
But I will never forget you.
You are the love of my life.

203
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,336
As are you.

204
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,837
And, uh, you.

205
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:58,136
I don't know you, but I'd like to.

206
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,642
I got to go!

207
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,742
I don't wanna leave you either.

208
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,715
But you know how Shrek is.
The dude's lost without me.

209
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,986
But don't worry. I'll send you
airmail kisses every day!

210
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,689
Be strong, babies.

211
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,260
Ooco, Peanut, listen to your mama.

212
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,388
Bananas, no roasting marshmallows
on your sister's head.

213
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,028
That's my special boy!

214
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,263
Oome here, all of you!
Give your daddy a big hug!

215
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,177
Shrek?

216
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:40,481
Maybe you should just stay and be King.

217
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,146
Oome on. There's no way
I could run a kingdom.

218
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,281
That's why your cousin Arthur
is a perfect choice.

219
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,951
It's not that. You see...

220
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:54,555
And if he gives me trouble,
I always have persuasion and reason.

221
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,033
Here's persuasion... and here's reason.

222
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,838
Fiona...

223
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,239
...soon it's just going to be you, me...

224
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,038
...and our swamp.

225
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,372
It's not going to be just you and me.

226
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,551
All aboard!

227
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,554
It will be. I promise.

228
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,215
I love you.

229
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,494
That's lovely.

230
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,227
Bye-bye, babies!

231
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,004
Shrek!

232
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,441
- Wait!
- What is it?

233
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,072
I'm ... I'm ...

234
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,952
I love you, too, honey!

235
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,922
No! I said I'm ...

236
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,362
You're what?

237
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,931
I said I'm pregnant!

238
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,570
What was that?

239
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,765
You're going to be a father!

240
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,407
That's great!

241
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,810
Really? I'm glad you think so!

242
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,348
I love you!

243
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,474
Yeah!

244
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,951
Me, too! You!

245
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:30,317
I'm going to be an uncle!
I'm going to be an uncle!

246
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,522
And you, my friend, are royally...

247
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,226
Home.

248
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,848
Shrek!

249
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,518
Fiona!

250
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,857
Fiona?

251
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,479
Oh, no.

252
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,552
Better out than in, I always say.

253
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,561
No, no, no!

254
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,294
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

255
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,736
Stop! Hey, wait!

256
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,651
Donkey. Donkey!

257
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,023
Wake up!

258
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,796
Dada!

259
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,227
Shrek! Are you okay?

260
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:33,502
I can't believe I'm going to be
a father. How did this happen?

261
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:37,843
Allow me to explain. When a man
has feelings for a woman...

262
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,508
...a powerful urge sweeps over him.

263
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,143
I know how it happened.

264
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,048
I just can't believe it.

265
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,658
How does it happen?

266
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:02,936
<i>And the cat's in the cradle</i>
<i>and the silver spoon</i>

267
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,702
<i>Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon</i>

268
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,438
<i>When you coming home, son?</i>
<i>I don't know when</i>

269
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,878
<i>But we'll get together then, Dad</i>.

270
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,007
Donkey! Oan you just cut to the part

271
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,676
where you're supposed
to make me feel better?

272
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,946
You know I love Fiona, boss. Right?

273
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,151
What I am talking about
is you, me, my cousin's boat...

274
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:28,892
...an ice cold pitcher of mojitos
and two weeks of nothing but fishing.

275
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,899
Don't listen to him!

276
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,732
Having a baby
isn't going to ruin your life.

277
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:38,400
It's not my life I'm worried
about ruining, it's the kid's .

278
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:42,843
When have you ever heard the phrase
"as sweet as an ogre" ...

279
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,415
...or " as nurturing as an ogre" ...

280
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,919
...or "You'll love
my dad. He's a real ogre."

281
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,818
Okay. I get it.

282
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,415
It's not going to be easy.
But you got us to help you.

283
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,255
That's true.

284
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,862
I'm doomed.

285
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,658
You'll be fine.

286
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,466
You're finished.

287
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,399
Uh, with yourjourney.

288
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:21,018
"Wor-ces-ters-shiree" ?
Now that sounds fancy!

289
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,483
It's Worcestershire.

290
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,452
Like the sauce?

291
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,920
It's spicy!

292
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,592
They must be expecting us.

293
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,300
What in the shista-shire
kind of place is this?

294
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:45,637
Well, my stomach aches and my palms
just got sweaty. Must be a high school.

295
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,937
High school?

296
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,636
Ready? Okay!

297
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,214
Wherefore art thou headed, to the top?

298
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,308
Yeah, we think so, we think so! And
dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped?

299
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,921
Nay, we thinkst not, we thinkst not!

300
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:07,187
All right, Mr. Percival,
ease up on the reins.

301
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:14,232
For lo, bro, don't burn
all my frankincense and myrrh.

302
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:17,864
I'm feeling nauseous from memories
of wedgies and swirlies!

303
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:22,673
How did you receive wedgies when you are
clearly not the wearer of underpants?

304
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,715
Let's just say some things
are better left unsaid.

305
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,911
So I was all like, " I'd rather get
the black plague than go out with you."

306
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,387
- Oh, totally.
- Pardon me.

307
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,322
- Totally ew-eth.
- Yeah, totally.

308
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,522
I just altered my character level
to +3 superb-ability.

309
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,224
Hi. We're looking for someone named...

310
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:46,895
Who rolled a +9 dork spell and
summoned the beast and his quadruped?

311
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,234
I know you're busy not fitting in, but
can you tell me where I can find Arthur?

312
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,675
He's over there.

313
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:19,269
There is no sweeter taste
on thy tongue than victory!

314
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,573
Strong, handsome, face of a leader.

315
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:28,042
Does Arthur look like a king or what?

316
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,545
Sorry.

317
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,910
Did you say you were looking for Arthur?

318
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,486
That information is
on a need-to-know basis.

319
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,316
It's top secret!

320
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:42,051
Now, gentlemen, let's away.
To the showers!

321
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,189
Greetings, Your Majesty.

322
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,889
This is your lucky day.

323
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,826
What are you supposed to be?

324
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,234
Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun
or something?

325
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,732
Giant mutant... You made a funny.

326
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,178
Unhand me, monster!

327
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,280
Stop squirming, Arthur.

328
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,747
I'm not Arthur.

329
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,277
I am Lancelot.

330
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,084
That dork over there is Arthur.

331
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,359
This is, like, totally embarrassing...

332
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,093
...but Tiffany thinkest
thou vex her so soothly.

333
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:27,636
She thought perchance thou would
ask her to the Homecoming Dance.

334
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:28,864
Excuse me?

335
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:32,943
Like, whatever. She's into college guys
and mythical creatures.

336
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,474
Oh, Arthur...

337
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:42,313
...come out, come out, wherever you are!

338
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,983
You better run,
you little punk no-goodniks!

339
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:50,526
The days of Donkey Dumpy Drawers
are over!

340
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,965
Hold it.

341
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,695
We're here for the mascot contest.

342
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,573
We're here for the mascot contest, too.

343
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,238
This is a costume?

344
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,373
Worked on it all night long.

345
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,516
Looks pretty real to me.

346
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:19,054
If he were real, could I do this?

347
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,386
Or this?

348
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:28,530
If it were real, that would have been
agonizingly painful.

349
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,863
- Now watch this!
- That's quite enough, boys.

350
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,803
Thank you to Professor Primbottom
and his lecture...

351
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,339
...on "just say nay" .

352
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,542
And now, without further ado, let's give
a warm Worcestershire hoozah...

353
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,172
...to the winner
of our mascot contest, the...

354
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,341
...ogre?

355
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,719
That's right. I'm the new mascot.

356
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:56,486
So let's really try and beat
the other guys at...

357
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,756
...whatever it is they're doing!

358
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,293
This is all a bit unorthodox...

359
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:10,100
Where can I find Arthur Pendragon?

360
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,867
Hey, wait...

361
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,609
Olassic.

362
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,446
You should be ashamed of yourself!

363
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,986
I didn't do it. They did.

364
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,522
Please don't eat me.

365
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,994
Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!

366
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,660
I'm not here to eat him!

367
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:40,764
Time to pack up
your toothbrush and jammies.

368
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,135
You're the new King of Far Far Away.

369
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:44,935
What?

370
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:50,675
Artie a king?
More like the Mayor of Loserville!

371
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,409
Burn.

372
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,150
Is this for real?

373
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:05,695
Absolutely. Olean out your locker, kid.
You have a kingdom to run.

374
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,492
So, wait...l'm really the only heir?

375
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,165
The one and only.

376
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,164
Give me a second.

377
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,168
My good people...

378
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,039
...there's a lesson here for all of us.

379
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,479
Next time you're about to dunk a kid's
head in a chamber pot, stop and think,

380
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,108
" Hey, maybe this guy has feelings.

381
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,219
Maybe I should cut him some slack.

382
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,723
'Cause maybe... just maybe...

383
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:38,556
...this guy's gonna turn out to be,
I don't know, a king?

384
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:43,724
Maybe his first royal decree will be to
banish everyone who ever picked on him."

385
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,735
I'm looking at you, jousting team!

386
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,268
And Guin? Oh, Guin.

387
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,473
I've always loved you.

388
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,905
Good friends, it breaks my heart, but...

389
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,540
...enjoy your stay here in prison
while I rule the free world!

390
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,277
Okay, let's not overdo it.

391
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,753
I'm building my city, people...
on rock 'n ' roll!

392
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,755
You just overdid it.

393
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,528
Look at you!

394
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,194
You look darling.

395
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,533
Just precious. Look at her.

396
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,040
Any cravings since you got pregnant?

397
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,804
No. Not at all.

398
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,375
Do you smell ham?

399
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,643
It's present time!

400
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,581
Fiona, please open mine first.
It's the one in front.

401
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:44,354
" Oongratulations on your new
mess mak..." Oh, mess maker!

402
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,487
" Hopefully this helps.
Love, Oinderella."

403
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,494
- Look at that!
- What is it?

404
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,538
It's for the poopies.

405
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,230
Wait... babies poop?

406
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,705
Everyone poops, Beauty.

407
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,309
Fiona!

408
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,277
We all chipped in
for a little present, too.

409
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,739
Ta-da!

410
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,783
You know the baby will love it,
because I do!

411
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,889
Guys, that's so sweet. Thank you.

412
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,422
Who's this one from?

413
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,493
I got you the biggest one,
because I love you most.

414
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,687
" Have one on me. Love, Snow White."

415
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,160
What is it?

416
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,826
He's a live-in babysitter.

417
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,062
Where's the baby?

418
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:31,266
You're too kind, Snow,
but I can't accept this.

419
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,775
It's nothing. I have six more at home.

420
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,674
- What does he do?
- Oleaning.

421
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,405
- Feeding.
- Burping.

422
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,016
So, what are
Shrek and I supposed to do?

423
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,278
Work on your marriage.

424
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,288
Thanks, Rapunzel.
What's that supposed to mean?

425
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:50,451
Oome on now, Fiona.
You know what happens.

426
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,421
You're tired all the time.

427
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,293
You start letting yourself go.

428
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,593
Stretch marks.

429
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,065
Say goodbye to romance.

430
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,841
I'm sorry, but how many
of you have kids?

431
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,533
She's right!

432
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:10,113
A baby will only strengthen the love
Shrek and Fiona have.

433
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,081
How did Shrek react when you told him?

434
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:17,415
When he first found out, Shrek said...

435
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:34,602
Onward, my new friends!
To our happily ever afters!

436
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,439
Now... bombs away!

437
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,830
Well, well, well. If it isn't Peter Pan.

438
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,434
- His name's not Peter.
- Shut it, Wendy.

439
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:26,650
Enough pillaging! To the castle!

440
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,476
You go! Take care of the baby!

441
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,774
Everybody stay calm! We're going to die!

442
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,312
Everyone in! Now!

443
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,581
Oome on! Put some back into it!

444
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,416
We don't have time. Now go!

445
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,358
Quickly, ladies!

446
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,190
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

447
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:27,282
Where are Shrek and Fiona?

448
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,579
The name doesn't ring a bell.

449
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,415
No bell.

450
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,923
I suggest you freaks cooperate...

451
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,653
...with the new King of Far Far Away!

452
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:41,492
The only thing you're ever gonna
be king of is King of the Stupids!

453
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,930
- Hook!
- Right!

454
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,298
Avast, ye cookie.

455
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,567
Start talking.

456
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,436
- Gingy!
- Papa!

457
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,946
Settle down now.

458
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,228
<i>On the good ship Lollipop</i>

459
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,802
<i>It's a sweet trip to the candy shop</i>

460
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:19,925
You!

461
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,966
You can't lie.

462
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:26,770
So tell me, puppet... where is Shrek?

463
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,011
Well... I don't know where he's not.

464
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,345
You don't know where Shrek is?

465
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,080
It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume...

466
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:42,488
...that I couldn't exactly not say that
is or isn't almost partially incorrect.

467
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:43,992
So you do know where he is!

468
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,653
On the contrary,
I'm possibly more or less

469
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,027
not definitely rejecting the idea

470
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:52,829
that in no way,
with any amount of uncertainty...

471
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,959
Stop it!

472
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,232
...I do not know where he shouldn't be.

473
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,842
If that indeed wasn't where he isn't .

474
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:02,571
Even if he wasn't not where
I knew he was, it could mean...

475
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,943
<i>On the good ship Lollipop</i>

476
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:09,485
Enough! Shrek went off
to bring back the next heir!

477
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,287
He's bringing back the next heir?

478
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,915
No!

479
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:20,358
Hook! Get rid of this new " King" .

480
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,363
But bring Shrek to me.

481
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,697
I have something special
in mind for him.

482
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,997
He'll never fall for your tricks!

483
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,335
Oh, boy.

484
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:44,211
I can't believe it. Me, a king?

485
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,381
I knew I came from royalty, but...

486
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,618
...I figured everyone forgot about me.

487
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,491
Oh, no. In fact the King
asked for you personally.

488
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,191
Really? Wow.

489
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,765
But I know it's not all fun and games.

490
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,896
It really is
all fun and games, actually.

491
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,635
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes,
launch a ship or two.

492
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:11,111
By the way, make sure you hit the boat
just right with the bottle.

493
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,046
Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle.

494
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:17,820
Well, I've heard
it's harder than it looks.

495
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,923
This is going to be huge.

496
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:24,926
Parties, princesses,
castles. Princesses.

497
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,929
You'll be living in the lap of luxury.

498
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,533
The finest chefs
will wait for your order.

499
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,637
And fortunately,
you'll have the royal food tasters.

500
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,466
What do they do?

501
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:40,202
Taste the food before the King eats,
to make sure it's not poisoned.

502
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,938
- Poisoned?
- Or too salty.

503
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,607
Don't worry. Your bodyguards
will keep you safe.

504
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,015
All of them willing
at a moment's notice

505
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,986
to lay down their lives
out of devotion to you.

506
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,556
Really?

507
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:56,717
The whole kingdom will look
to you for wisdom and guidance.

508
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,028
Make sure they don't die of famine!

509
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,892
- Or plague.
- Plague is bad.

510
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,932
The coughing, the groaning,
the festering sores.

511
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:09,940
Festering sores!
You are one funny kitty cat.

512
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,007
What did I say?

513
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,509
We don't want Artie
getting the wrong idea.

514
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,439
Artie?

515
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,481
There goes my hip!

516
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,781
Artie! What are you doing?

517
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,851
What does it look like?!

518
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,997
This really isn't up to you.

519
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,998
I don't know anything about being king!

520
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,068
You'll learn on the job!

521
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,496
Sorry, but I'm going back.

522
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,075
Back to what? Being a loser?

523
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,205
Now look what you did!

524
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:55,816
Look what I did?
-
Who's holding the wheel, chief?

525
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,311
Shrek!

526
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,659
Land ho!

527
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,013
How humiliating.

528
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,953
Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

529
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:34,785
Now it's "Your Highness" ?
What happened to " loser" ?

530
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,826
If you think this is getting you
out of anything, it isn't .

531
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:41,728
We're heading back to Far Far Away
one way or another...

532
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:44,300
...and you're going to be a father!

533
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,868
What?

534
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,262
You just said "father" .

535
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:51,135
King! You're going to be king!

536
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,267
"You're going to be king!" Yeah, right.

537
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:56,912
Where are you going?

538
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,515
Far Far Away... from you!

539
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,618
Get back here, young man!

540
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,078
Boss? I don't think he's coming back.

541
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,420
Maybe it's for the best.
He's not exactly king material.

542
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,791
When did you plan to tell him
you were supposed to be king?

543
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,763
Oome on. Why would I do that?

544
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,960
Besides, he'll be ten times
better at it than me.

545
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:23,062
Then change your tactics
if you want to get anywhere with him.

546
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,240
You're right, Donkey.

547
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,104
What about this?

548
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:35,082
- Shrek!
- Oome on. It's just a joke.

549
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,985
Still...

550
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,433
Listen, Artie.

551
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:02,138
If you think this whole mad scene
ain't dope, I feel you, dude.

552
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:06,409
I'm not trying to get up in your grill
or raise your roof.

553
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,677
But what I am screamin' is, yo...

554
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:12,016
...check out this
kazing thazing, bazaby!

555
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,249
If it doesn't groove, or what I'm saying

556
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,326
ain't straight trippin',
say, " Oh, no, you didn't !

557
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,895
You're getting on my last nerve."

558
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,022
And then I'll know it's ...
I'll know it's wack!

559
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:25,829
Help!

560
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,371
I've been kidnapped by a monster
who's trying to relate to me!

561
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:33,135
- Artie, wait.
- Oome on! Help! Hello?

562
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:38,342
Greetings, cosmic children
of the universe.

563
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,416
Welcome to my serenity circle.

564
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:44,681
Please leave any bad vibes
outside the healing vortex.

565
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,653
Now prepare to...

566
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,162
I knew I should have got that warranty!

567
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,535
Mr. Merlin?

568
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,137
You know this guy?

569
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:05,537
Yeah. He was the school magic teacher,
until he had his nervous breakdown.

570
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:09,043
Technically, I was merely a victim
of a level 3 fatigue.

571
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,272
At the request of my therapist,

572
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:15,044
and the school authorities, I retired
to the tranquility of nature

573
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,346
to discover my divine purpose.

574
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:22,257
Oan I interest anyone
in a snack or beverage?

575
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,485
Uh, no.

576
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,960
Sure you don't want to try
my Rock Au Gratin?

577
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,334
It's organic.

578
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,902
Thanks. I ate a boulder on the way in.

579
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,973
We need directions to Far Far Away.

580
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,632
"We" ? Who said I was going with you?

581
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:44,146
I did. People are counting on you,
so don't try to weasel out of it.

582
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,340
If the job's so great, you do it.

583
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:51,150
Understand this, kid. No more
Mr. Nice Guy from here on out.

584
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,586
That was your Mr. Nice Guy?

585
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,658
Yeah, and I'm going to miss him.

586
00:44:55,793 --> 00:45:00,196
Why don't you go terrorize a village
and leave me alone!

587
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:04,858
Was that a crack about ogres? You get
your royal highness to Far Far Away...

588
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:09,029
...before I kick it there!
Now, which way am I kicking?

589
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,004
I could tell you, but since you're

590
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,666
in the midst
of a self-destructive rage spiral,

591
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,336
it would be karmically irresponsible.

592
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,143
Self-destructive...?
Are you going to help us or not?

593
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,878
Most definitely, but only after you

594
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,217
take the journey to your soul!

595
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,721
I don't think so.

596
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:31,692
It's either that
or primal scream therapy.

597
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,426
All right. Journey to the soul.

598
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,132
Now, all of you,

599
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,794
look into the Fire of Truth

600
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,931
and tell me what you see.

601
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,643
Ooh, charades!

602
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:54,547
Okay, I see a Dutch fudge torte
with cinnamon swirls!

603
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,279
Okay, monster... go for it.

604
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,658
I see a rainbow pony.

605
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,732
Excellent work! Now the boy.

606
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,334
This is lame.

607
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,732
You're lame! Now just go for it.

608
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:16,636
Okay.

609
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:21,911
There's a baby bird and a father bird
sitting in a nest.

610
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:24,036
Yes! Stay with it!

611
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:28,875
The dad just flew away. Why did
he leave the little bird all alone?

612
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,989
It's trying to fly,
but it doesn't know how to.

613
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,052
It's going to fall!

614
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:44,891
Proper head case you are.
Really messed up.

615
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:53,232
Okay, I get it. The bird's me.
My dad left. So what?

616
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,917
Look, Artie, um...

617
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:15,026
Just thought I'd help set the mood...

618
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,498
...for your big heart-to-heart chat.

619
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:30,277
I know what it's like
to not feel ready for something.

620
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,948
Even ogres get scared.

621
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,619
You know... once in a while.

622
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:44,390
I know you want me
to be king, but I can't .

623
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,395
I'm not cut out for it,
and I never will be.

624
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,789
Even my own dad knew
I wasn't worth the trouble.

625
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:54,131
He dumped me at that school
first chance he got...

626
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:57,137
...and I never heard from him again.

627
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:02,643
My dad wasn't really
the fatherly type, either.

628
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,307
I doubt he was worse than mine.

629
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,446
Oh, yeah?

630
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:11,645
My father was an ogre.
He tried to eat me.

631
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,684
I guess I should have realized it.

632
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:19,091
He bathed me in barbecue sauce and
put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.

633
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,489
I guess that's pretty bad.

634
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,031
It may be hard to believe,

635
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:31,629
what, with my obvious charm
and good looks,

636
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:34,710
but people used
to think I was a monster.

637
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:38,508
And for a long time, I believed them.

638
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:42,109
But after a while,

639
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,779
you learn to ignore
the names people call you

640
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,255
and just trust who you are.

641
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,523
You know... you're okay, Shrek.

642
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,925
You just need to do a little less
yelling and use a little more soap.

643
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,896
Thanks, Artie.

644
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:04,701
The soap's because
you stink... really bad.

645
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,367
Yeah... I got that.

646
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:15,249
This place is filthy!

647
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:17,144
I feel like a hobo.

648
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:21,152
I'm sorry, but this
isn't working for me.

649
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,853
Everything's always about you.
It's not like your attitude is helping.

650
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:29,693
Maybe itjust bothers you
I was voted fairest in the land.

651
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,926
You mean in that rigged election?

652
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,038
Give me a break. " Rapunzel, Rapunzel...

653
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:38,300
...let down thy golden extensions!"

654
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:43,243
Ladies, let go of your petty complaints
and let's work together!

655
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:49,208
So I guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly

656
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,446
in this stinkhole until we rot.

657
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:55,115
No, we get inside and find out
what Oharming's up to.

658
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,954
I know he's a jerk and everything,

659
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:02,259
but that Oharming
makes me hotter than July.

660
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,931
That's it!

661
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,329
Oome on! This way!

662
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:36,454
Rapunzel, wait!

663
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,807
Oharming, let go of her.

664
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,572
But why would I want to do that?

665
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,108
What?

666
00:50:57,254 --> 00:51:02,351
Say hello, ladies,
to the new Queen of Far Far Away.

667
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,160
Rapunzel, how could you?

668
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,562
Jealous much?

669
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,134
Soon you'll be back
where you started,

670
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,898
scrubbing floors
or locked away in towers.

671
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:19,668
That is, if I let you last the week.

672
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,572
Pookie, you promised not to hurt them.

673
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:28,707
Not here, kitten whiskers.
Daddy will discuss it later.

674
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,978
Now forgive us.
We have a show to put on.

675
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:35,387
Shrek will be back soon,
and you'll be sorry.

676
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:36,924
Sorry?!

677
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,326
Don't you realize once Shrek
sets foot in Far Far Away...

678
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,228
...he's doomed?

679
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,399
Look out! They got a piano!

680
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,908
Kill them all... except the fat one.

681
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:32,413
King Oharming has something special
in mind for you, ogre.

682
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:33,846
King Oharming?

683
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,008
Attack!

684
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,451
Artie, duck!

685
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,269
Ready the plank!

686
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,651
- Shrek!
- Help!

687
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:36,275
Oowards!

688
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,779
What has Oharming done with Fiona?

689
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,509
She's going to get what's coming to her.

690
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:46,988
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop him!

691
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,648
- We've got to save her.
- But she's so far far away!

692
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,892
Get yourself back
to Worcestershire, kid.

693
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:56,521
No, Shrek. Hold on. I've got an idea.

694
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,930
I am a buzzing bee.

695
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:02,800
Mr. Merlin?
They need a spell to get them...

696
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:05,965
...I mean us, back to Far Far Away.

697
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:09,545
Forget it. I don't have that kind
of magic in me anymore.

698
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,376
How about a hug?
That's the best kind of magic.

699
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,882
Please. I know you can do it.

700
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,816
I said forget it!

701
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:19,285
But...

702
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,288
What's with you?

703
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,796
It's just so hard, you know?

704
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:37,600
They need to get back,
'cause their kingdom's in trouble.

705
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,266
'Cause there's a really bad man.

706
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,173
It's just so hard!

707
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,439
Take it easy.

708
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:47,948
No! I don't think you understand!

709
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:52,612
There's a mean person doing
mean things to good people.

710
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,451
Have a heart, old man.

711
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:58,755
They really need your help to get back.
Why won't you help them?!

712
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,191
Okay.

713
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,325
I'll go get my things.

714
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,299
Piece of cake.

715
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,967
Well, well. You want eggs with that ham?

716
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,807
I am a little rusty, so there
could be some side effects.

717
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:19,414
- Side effects?
- Don't worry.

718
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:23,315
Whatever it is, no matter
how excruciatingly painful,

719
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:26,616
it will wear off eventually. I think.

720
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,821
- Oops.
- You sure about this?

721
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,090
If Artie trusts him,
that's good enough for me.

722
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,096
Even if his robe doesn't cover...

723
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,758
Alacritious expeditious...

724
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,599
...a-zoomy-zoom-zoom!

725
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,572
Let's help our friends get back...

726
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,642
...soon!

727
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,578
It worked!

728
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:10,323
I haven't been on a trip
like that since college!

729
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,029
Donkey?

730
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:15,001
What? Is something in my teeth?

731
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,434
Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into
a Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick!

732
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:28,842
At least you don't look
like some kind of bloated piata!

733
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,044
You should think about going on a diet!

734
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:35,783
You should get yourself a pair of pants.
I feel all exposed and nasty!

735
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,792
So you two think this is funny?

736
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:44,095
I'm really sorry, guys.

737
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,702
Don't be. You got us back, kid.

738
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,502
How in the Hans Ohristian Andersen

739
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:57,408
am I supposed to parade around
in these goofy boots?

740
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,380
Hey, hey, hey!
Be very careful with those.

741
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:05,151
They were made in Madrid
by the finest...

742
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,813
You'll learn to control that.

743
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:15,721
Seriously. Ow! You need some comfort
inserts or arch supports or something.

744
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:26,774
Watch it. I'm walking here
and I'm gonna keep going until...

745
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,002
Pinocchio!

746
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:30,770
Shrek! Help me!

747
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:34,111
- What happened?
- Oharming and the villains took over!

748
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,016
Fiona and the Princesses got away.
Now she's ...

749
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,678
She's what?! What?!

750
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,856
Puss! Loan me five bucks.

751
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,223
You heard him. Help the brother out.

752
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,455
Do you see any pockets on me?

753
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,429
Hold on a second.

754
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:57,100
I had no idea, really. I... I swear.

755
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,469
Quick! Where is Fiona?

756
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:04,376
Oharming has her locked away
someplace. You have to find him!

757
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:07,381
He's probably getting ready
for the show!

758
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,849
Wait, Pinocchio! What show?

759
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:17,258
" It's a Happily Ever After After All" .

760
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,725
" Shrek's final performance" ?

761
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:23,993
Shrek! You didn't tell us
you were in a play!

762
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:27,591
I guess I've been so busy
I forgot to mention it.

763
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,295
The ogre! Get him!

764
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,972
Don't worry, <i>jefe</i>. I got this.

765
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,143
Uck! Kill it!

766
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:47,282
Look. Don't you know who
he thinks he is? How dare you!

767
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,947
We're dealing with amateurs.

768
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:54,029
He's a star, people! Hello?
I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.

769
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,687
I'm going to lose it!

770
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:59,632
Is everything ready? You did get
the list for the dressing room?

771
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:02,863
Breakfast croissant stuffed
with seared sashimi tuna.

772
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:06,305
And I hope you have the saffron corn
with jalapeno honey butter.

773
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:09,434
Our client cannot get
into his proper emotional state

774
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,376
withoutjalapeno honey butter!

775
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:12,913
I just lost it.

776
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,208
They should talk to Nancy
in Human Resources.

777
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,844
Oh, we will have much to say
to Nancy, I promise!

778
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:25,221
"With this sword, I do..." No. "With..."

779
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:29,024
"With this sword, I do smote thee!"

780
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:32,401
Is " smote" the right word? " Smoot" ?

781
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,400
I don't think that's a word.

782
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:38,871
Maybe I should just " smite" him.
Let's try this again. Now...

783
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:43,206
Shrek attacks me.
I pretend to be afraid.

784
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:48,350
" Now the kingdom will get the happily
ever after they deserve. Die, ogre!"

785
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:52,147
Blah, blah, blah. Oh,
itjust doesn't feel real enough!

786
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,082
Who told you to stop dancing?!

787
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:57,692
Wink and turn.

788
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:01,058
What are you laying around for?
Get up! Honestly!

789
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:12,936
Our happily ever after
is nearly complete, Mummy.

790
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,271
And I assure you...

791
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:20,405
...the people of this kingdom
will pay dearly for every second...

792
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,245
...we've had to wait.

793
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:26,287
Break a leg.

794
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,186
On second thought,
let me break it for you.

795
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:33,625
Thank goodness. I was afraid
you wouldn't get back in time.

796
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,390
Where's Fiona?

797
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:39,763
Don't worry. She and the others
are safe... for now.

798
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:52,278
Let me guess. Arthur.

799
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,974
It's Artie, actually.

800
01:00:55,118 --> 01:01:00,112
This boy is supposed to be
the new King of Far Far Away?

801
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:03,322
How pathetic.

802
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:06,326
Stand still, so I won't make a mess.

803
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:09,898
Oharming, stop! I'm here now.
You got what you wanted.

804
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,694
This isn't about him.

805
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:16,802
Then who's it about?
I'm supposed to be king, right?

806
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:22,510
You weren't really next in line
for the throne.

807
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,044
I was.

808
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,513
But you said the King
asked for me personally.

809
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,481
Not exactly.

810
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,052
What does that mean?

811
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,678
I said whatever I had to say, all right?

812
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:37,520
I wasn't right for the job,
so I needed some fool to replace me.

813
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:41,323
And you fit the bill. So just go!

814
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,459
You were playing me the whole time.

815
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:48,365
You catch on real fast, kid.

816
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:51,598
Maybe you're not
as big of a loser as I thought.

817
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,380
You know, for a minute...

818
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:02,416
- ...I actually thought...
- What?

819
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:06,044
That he cared about you? He's an ogre.

820
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,020
What did you expect?

821
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,027
You really do have a way
with children, Shrek.

822
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:38,183
<i>Leave me out with the waste</i>

823
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:41,256
<i>This is not what I do</i>

824
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:45,087
<i>It's the wrong time</i>

825
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,924
<i>She's pulling me through</i>

826
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:51,761
<i>It's a small crime</i>

827
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:54,529
<i>And I got no excuse</i>

828
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:57,070
<i>And is that all right, yeah?</i>

829
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,566
<i>Is that all right with you?</i>

830
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:05,744
<i>Is that all right, yeah?</i>

831
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:10,242
<i>If I give my gun away when it's loaded?</i>

832
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:17,085
<i>If you don't shoot it</i>
<i>how am I supposed to hold it?</i>

833
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:23,130
<i>Is that all right?</i>
<i>Is that all right?</i>

834
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:26,702
<i>Is that all right with you?</i>

835
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:27,303
<i>No</i>.

836
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:27,701
<i>No</i>.

837
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:29,868
Had we stayed put like I suggested,

838
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:32,804
we'd be sipping tea
out of little heart-shaped cups.

839
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:34,466
Yeah, heart-shaped cups.

840
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,238
And eating crumpets
smothered with loganberries.

841
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,972
Yeah, loganberries.

842
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:40,980
- Shut up, Oindy.
- Yeah, shut up.

843
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,984
- No, you shut up.
- Stay out of this.

844
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,918
Who cares who's " running the kingdom" ?

845
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:50,287
- I care.
- You should all care.

846
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:57,164
I have your badge number, tin can!

847
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,165
- Donkey?
- Princess!

848
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:00,291
Puss?

849
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:04,497
I am Puss, stuck here
inside this hideous body.

850
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,664
And I'm me!

851
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:06,934
But you're...

852
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,738
Everything's fruity in the loops,
but what happened is

853
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,847
we went to high school,
the boat crashed

854
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,541
and we got bippity-boppity-booped
by the magic man.

855
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,879
You poor sweet things.

856
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,418
I don't get it.

857
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:22,285
The cat turned into a little horse
that smells like feet. What's to get?

858
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,790
Who dat?

859
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:24,950
Where's Shrek?

860
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:29,087
Oharming has him. He plans to kill Shrek
tonight in front of the whole kingdom!

861
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:34,663
All right, everyone.
We need to find a way out now.

862
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:38,331
You're right.
Ladies, assume the position!

863
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,406
What are you doing?

864
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,546
Waiting to be rescued.

865
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:48,650
You've got to be kidding me.

866
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:51,548
What else can we do? We're just four...

867
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:54,986
...I mean three, super-hot princesses...

868
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:59,185
...two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre
and an old lady!

869
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:04,363
Excuse me. Old lady coming through.

870
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,772
Mom!

871
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:19,177
You didn't think you got your fighting
skills from your father, did you?

872
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:22,045
Excuse me. There's still one more.

873
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:34,560
Why don't you just lie down?

874
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:40,100
Okay, girls, from here on out...

875
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:42,704
...we take care of business ourselves.

876
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:04,283
<i>The Far Far Away Theatre at the</i>
<i>Charming Pavilion is proud to present</i>...

877
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,190
...<i>"It's A Happily Ever After</i>
<i>After AII."</i>

878
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:09,628
Enjoy your evening
of theatrical reverie, citizen.

879
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:13,098
Oi! No food or beverages in the theater!

880
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:28,314
Places, everyone!

881
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:34,582
Easy!

882
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:38,626
Sorry. I was showing off
for the little one.

883
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:42,957
It's Bring Your Kids to Work Day.
Oome here, beautiful.

884
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:49,127
Well, she's got your eye.

885
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:55,310
Who would have thought a monster like
me deserved something as special as you?

886
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:40,012
<i>Little birdies, take wing</i>

887
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:43,484
<i>Flitting down from the trees they appear</i>

888
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,094
<i>And to chirp in my ear</i>

889
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:50,355
<i>All because I sing</i>

890
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:21,053
Move it! Go!

891
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,399
My babies!

892
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:31,395
Help!

893
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,943
Hey, how's it goin'

894
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,566
O to the K. The coast is clear.

895
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,328
Let's do this. Go, Team Dynamite!

896
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:38,304
I thought we agreed to use the name
Team Super Oool.

897
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,670
I recall it was Team Awesome.

898
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:42,743
I voted for Team Alpha Wolf Squadron.

899
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,846
Okay! From henceforth,

900
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:49,110
we will be Team Alpha Super Awesome
Oool Dynamite Wolf Squadron.

901
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:53,483
<i>Ach de liebe!</i> There is some strange
little girl over there staring at us!

902
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:55,788
Artie!

903
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,290
Wait, wait!

904
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,621
Where is the fire, <i>seor?</i>

905
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:01,787
Please. Don't act so innocent.

906
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:05,697
You both knew what was going on
and kept it to yourselves.

907
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,426
It's not like it seems.

908
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:10,403
It's not? I think it seems pretty clear.

909
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,064
He was using me. That's all.

910
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,643
Using you? You really don't get it.

911
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:18,770
Shrek only said
those things to protect you.

912
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:24,112
Oharming was going to kill you, Artie!
Shrek saved your life.

913
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,289
Oue the spot!

914
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:42,660
<i>I wait alone up here</i>

915
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:45,501
<i>I'm trapped another day</i>

916
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:48,838
<i>Locked up here, please set me free</i>

917
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:52,004
<i>My new life I almost see</i>

918
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,843
<i>A castle, you and me</i>

919
01:10:54,984 --> 01:11:00,081
<i>Yes, a castle, you and me</i>

920
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:03,215
Oherubs!

921
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:10,962
<i>Tis I, Tis I</i>
<i>Upon my regal steed</i>

922
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,727
<i>Princess, my love</i>

923
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:15,632
<i>At last you shall be freed</i>
<i>I'm strong</i>

924
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,739
<i>And brave</i>
<i>And dashing my way there</i>

925
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:23,839
<i>With speed! With might!</i>
<i>With soft and bouncy hair!</i>

926
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:28,579
<i>- Through the blistering desert</i>
<i>- Hot!</i>

927
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:31,743
<i>- Across the stormiest sea</i>
<i>- Wet!</i>

928
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,878
<i>Facing creatures so vile</i>

929
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,149
<i>Foul!</i>

930
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:39,421
<i>So you can gaze upon me!</i>

931
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:43,061
<i>I knew you'd come for me</i>

932
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:47,032
<i>And now we finally meet</i>

933
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:48,636
<i>I knew you'd wait</i>

934
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:53,299
<i>And from my plate of love you'd eat</i>

935
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:16,561
<i>Who is this terribly ugly fiend</i>
<i>Who so rudely intervened?</i>

936
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:18,530
<i>Will Charming fight or flee?</i>

937
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:19,725
<i>Please rescue me!</i>

938
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,563
<i>From this monstrosity!</i>

939
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:26,732
<i>Fear thee not, honey lamb!</i>
<i>I will slice this thing up like a ham!</i>

940
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,377
Oh, boy.

941
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:33,106
<i>You are about to enter a world of pain</i>

942
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:37,582
<i>With which you are not familiar!</i>

943
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:45,426
It can't be any more painful
than your lousy performance.

944
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,089
" Prepare, foul beast."

945
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:56,467
Prepare, foul beast, your time is done!

946
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:59,768
Oould you kill me and then sing?

947
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:02,971
Be quiet!

948
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:07,242
I'm just having fun with you.
That's actually a very nice leotard.

949
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:08,645
Thank you.

950
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:10,877
Do they come in men's sizes?

951
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:15,685
Now that be funny!

952
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:17,792
Enough!

953
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:23,995
Now you'll finally
know what it's like...

954
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:27,660
...to have everything you worked for...

955
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:31,830
...everything that's precious to you,
taken away.

956
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:35,307
Now you'll know how I felt.

957
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,312
Sausage roll!

958
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:04,195
Pray for mercy from Puss!

959
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:05,829
And Donkey!

960
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:07,099
D

961
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,382
Hi, honey.

962
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:22,547
Sorry we're late. You okay?

963
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:25,023
Much better, now that you're here.

964
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:32,895
So, Oharming, you want to let me out of
these so we can settle this ogre-to-man?

965
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:37,369
Ooh, that sounds fun.
But I have a better idea.

966
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,622
No! Let go of me!

967
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:59,887
You will not ruin things
this time, ogre. Kill it.

968
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,495
Everybody, stop!

969
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,429
Oh, what is it now?!

970
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:10,833
Artie?

971
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,984
Who thinks we need
to settle things this way?

972
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:30,953
You mean you want to be villains
your whole lives?

973
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:34,893
But we are villains!
It's the only thing we know.

974
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,464
You never wish
you could be something else?

975
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:41,057
Easy for you to say. You're not
some evil enchanted tree.

976
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,967
You morons! Don't listen to him! Attack!

977
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:46,904
What Steve means is
it's hard to come by honest work

978
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,067
when the whole world's against you.

979
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,940
Right. Thanks, Ed.

980
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:55,482
Fair enough. You're right.
I'm not a talking tree.

981
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:56,709
But you know...

982
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,980
...a good friend once told me...

983
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:05,150
...just because people treat you
like a villain, or an ogre...

984
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,285
...orjust some loser...

985
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,697
...doesn't mean you are one.

986
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:17,437
What matters most
is what you think of yourself.

987
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:21,873
If there's something you really want,
or someone you want to be...

988
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:25,639
...the only person standing
in your way is you.

989
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,911
- Me?
- Get him!

990
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,449
No, no, no!

991
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,520
What I mean is each of you...

992
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,918
...is standing in your own way.

993
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:41,318
I always wanted to play the flute.

994
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:45,126
I'd like to open up a spa... in France!

995
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:49,829
I grow daffodils. And they're beautiful.

996
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:41,716
A new era finally begins!

997
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:45,219
Now all of you...

998
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:48,461
...bow before your King!

999
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:57,235
You need to work on your aim.

1000
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:02,441
This was supposed to be
my happily ever after!

1001
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:05,068
Well, you need to keep looking...

1002
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,141
...because I'm not giving up mine.

1003
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:15,583
Mommy?

1004
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:29,096
It's yours if you want it.

1005
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:32,103
But this time it's your choice.

1006
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:55,820
Author!

1007
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:59,297
Artie! Artie! Artie! Artie!

1008
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:06,630
Excuse me. That's my seat.

1009
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:12,409
Okay, <i>Seor</i> Hocusy-Pocusy, the time
has come to rectify some wrongs!

1010
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,072
Though I have been enjoying
these cat baths.

1011
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:16,707
Please say you didn't .

1012
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:18,752
All right! Look.

1013
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:22,186
You'll feel a pinch and possibly
lower intestinal discomfort...

1014
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:24,656
...but this should do the trick.

1015
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:31,365
- Are you...?
- I'm me again!

1016
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,764
- And I am not you!
- All right!

1017
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:36,497
Oops.

1018
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:39,906
Ah, never mind.

1019
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:47,973
What did I tell you?
The kid's going to be a great king.

1020
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:51,677
Well, for what it's worth,
you would have, too.

1021
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:56,180
I have something
much more important in mind.

1022
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:22,944
Finally.

1023
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:31,055
Dada.

1024
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:37,530
<i>Was I wrong about the world?</i>
<i>It's a beautiful new place</i>

1025
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,157
I smell Shrek Junior!

1026
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:42,964
<i>Where else could a creep like me</i>

1027
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:45,834
<i>Meet such a pretty face</i>

1028
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:49,910
<i>Meeting every day with the rising sun</i>

1029
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:55,615
<i>Looking up, it's looking like</i>

1030
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:58,412
<i>My losing streak is done</i>

1031
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:00,618
Peek-a-boo!

1032
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:02,086
Peek-a-boo!

1033
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:07,124
A bouncy, bouncy, boy!

1034
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:09,958
<i>Used to always feel like</i>

1035
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:12,760
<i>Wished that I was dressed better</i>

1036
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:15,429
Where's the baby?

1037
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:19,939
<i>Never had a lot of luck</i>
<i>Until I finally met her</i>

1038
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:33,444
<i>Meeting every day with the rising sun</i>

1039
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:38,285
<i>Looking up, it's looking like</i>

1040
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,793
<i>My losing streak is done</i>

1041
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:46,297
<i>My losing streak is done</i>

1042
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:59,807
Well... what shall we do now?

1043
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,491
I got it.

1044
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:28,374
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Once again, come on!

1045
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:33,140
<i>I want to thank you for letting me</i>

1051
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:52,698
<i>Stiff all in the collar</i>

1052
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:56,697

<i>Everyday people</i>

1071
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:03,430
<i>Sing a simple song</i>

1072
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,931
<i>Mama's so happy</i>

1073
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:11,769
<i>Mama start to cry</i>

1074
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:16,439

Oome on, Donkey. Do something right!

1081

Put the hoofs together!
Put the hoofs together!

1082
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:47,175
Stomp your boots, baby! Stomp your
